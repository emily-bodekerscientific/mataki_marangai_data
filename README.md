Mātaki Marangai

This is a citizen science project in which students in Tairāwhiti collect and report daily precipitation amounts. The reporting is done through CitSci.org, and this repository fetches that data and commits it to a JSON file. This JSON is then used to plot the precipitation amounts per day on a map on the project website: https://sites.google.com/bodekerscientific.com/matakimarangai/precipitation-map
